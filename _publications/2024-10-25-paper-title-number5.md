Large Language Models demonstrate considerable fluency in human interaction. Despite their potentially transformative impact, their limits and capabilities are still to be discovered. To mitigate potential harm, and harness their potential for the benefit of society, it is important that we understand their capabilities in human-machine interaction. To address this challenge, we introduce the Sociological Turing Test (SocTT), and present results from a pilot study involving rock climbers and ChatGPT4. The SocTT adds to existing research by empowering expert members to ask any question they believe will distinguish between the machine and human. The paper emphasizes a sociological perspective in which the locus of expertise is in the social group and social interaction is how that expertise is expressed or demonstrated. Results show that despite limited success, ChatGPT fell short in passing as a rock climber. Experiential knowledge, in particular, embodiment, was a revealing distinction between human and machine. We conclude by emphasizing that the cultural fluency displayed by LLMs ultimatelly stems from human-ai ensembles.
