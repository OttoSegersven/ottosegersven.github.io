This article uses a novel method—the Imitation Game—to search for lasting ethnic biculturalism. I address the case of Finland-Swedes and the Finnish-speaking majority in Finland. While it is known that most Finland-Swedes are fluent in two languages, Swedish and Finnish, the question remains whether they are fluent in two respective cultures. The Imitation Game investigates biculturalism and alternative acculturation paths as a function of cultural competences. As part of a mixed-methods analysis, I introduce the Group Relations Graph as a comparative framework to pinpoint acculturation paths based on whether members of the minority can exhibit competence in minority and majority culture. The findings display acculturation as a dynamic process of multiple concurrent acculturation paths: the studied groups are assimilated with respect to values and experiences, and separated in terms of knowledge and linguistic style. Finland-Swedes are a powerful minority group with both the resources and the intention to maintain a unique Finland-Swedish culture, yet in terms of cultural competences they appear indistinguishable from the Finnish-speaking majority—except for within the context of an ethnic enclave institution. Ultimately, the article posits a pessimistic assessment for the possibility of lasting biculturalism and, by extension, a multicultural society.
