<!--This is my personal page to tell you about myself, my work and showcase my research projects and proposals.-->




<br>

I am Otto Segersven, a professional academic, amateur athlete and poet.

<br>


🎓 **In academia**, I'm a postdoctoral researcher whose research encompasses ethnic and religious relations, human-machine interactions, and human-nature connections. My overarching research commitment is to understand how we adopt and construct ways of knowing and -conduct in the world through interactions with others and our environments. I'm a mixed methods researcher with a methodological toolkit including interviews, surveys, experimental design and computational methods.




Feel free to explore my [CV](cv/), [publications](/publications1/) and [research projects](/projects1/).

**Beyond professional life**


🏃‍♂️ **I'm an avid rock climber and ultra runner**. Running is liberates and empowers and I've formulated many of my best sentences on the run. Climbing clears my mind and is refreshingly purposeless.


✍️ **I write poetry** to touch with the here and now and the pleasure of crafting an original thought in an original way. ✍️ <!--Poetry helps me to touch the here and now and perhaps grasp a glimpse of the universal, intersubjective experience.-->


🇸🇪🇫🇮🇩🇪🇪🇸🇬🇧🐍 My native **languages** are Swedish and Finnish, my working language is English, in my everyday life in Berlin I speak mainly German and Spanish and I am still learning to speak python with the computer.


📰 **Last but not least**, I'm an avid consumer of news, particularly interested in politics, international affairs, economics, technology and global environmental change.
