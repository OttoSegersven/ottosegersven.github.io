👋 **Hi there!** 


This is my personal page to tell you about myself, my work and showcase my research projects and proposals.


I am a professional academic, amateur athlete and poet.


🎓 **As an academic**, I'm a postdoctoral researcher. My research encompasses ethnic and religious relations, human-machine interactions, and human-nature connections. My overarching research commitment is to understand how we adopt and construct ways of knowing and -conduct in the world through interactions with others and our environments. I'm a mixed methods researcher with a methodological toolkit including interviews, surveys, experimental design and computational methods. 🎓 


Feel free to explore my CV, publications and research projects.


🏃‍♂️ **Beyond professional life I'm an avid rock climber and ultra runner**. Running allows me to collect my thoughts. It is both liberating and empowering and I've formulated many of my best sentences on the run. Climbing on the other hand clears my mind and connects me with the body. It is both fun and refreshingly purposeless. 🏃‍♂️


✍️ **I write poetry** out of love for language and the pleasure of crafting an original thought in an original way. Poetry helps me to touch the here and now and perhaps grasp a glimpse of the universal, intersubjective experience. ✍️


🇸🇪🇫🇮🇩🇪🇪🇸🇬🇧 My native **languages** are Swedish and Finnish, my working language is English, and in my everyday life in Berlin I speak mainly German and Spanish. 🇸🇪🇫🇮🇩🇪🇪🇸🇬🇧 


📰 **Last but not least**, I'm an avid consumer of news, particularly interested in politics, international affairs, economics, technology and global environmental change. 📰
