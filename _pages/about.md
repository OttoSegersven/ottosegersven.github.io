<!--This is my personal page to tell you about myself, my work and showcase my research projects and proposals.-->




<br>


ðŸŽ“ Iâ€™m Otto Segersven, a PhD in Social Sciences, currently working at the Department of Computer Science at the University of Helsinki on the [AI Literacy Project](https://ailit.fi). Alongside this, I serve as an independent grant-funded researcher on the project [What Sets Us Apart? Identifying AI-Enhanced Expertise in Human-Machine Interaction](https://koneensaatio.fi/en/grants-and-residencies/what-sets-us-apart-identifying-ai-enhanced-expertise-in-human-machine-interaction-2/) and I am the product owner of the Competence Imitation Game application. My research explores the emerging forms of collaboration and competence that arise as AI becomes integrated into various domains of life. Iâ€™m particularly interested in how AI reshapes human expertise and the boundaries between human and machine capabilities. Previously, my research focused on the role of cultural competence and bicultural fluency in ethnic and religious relations in contemporary society. Iâ€™m a mixed methods researcher skilled in interviews, surveys, and experimental design.

*Beyond professional life*


I'm a rock climber and ultra runner. Running liberates and empowers and I've formulated many of my best sentences on the run. Climbing clears my mind and is refreshingly purposeless.


I write poetry for the pleasure of crafting an original thought in an original way.  <!--Poetry helps me to touch the here and now and perhaps grasp a glimpse of the universal, intersubjective experience.-->


My native languages are Swedish and Finnish, my working language is English, in my everyday life in Berlin I speak mainly German and Spanish and I am still learning to speak Python with the computer.


I'm an avid consumer of news, particularly interested in politics, international affairs, economics, technology and global environmental change.
