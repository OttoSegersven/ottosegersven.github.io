<!--This is my personal page to tell you about myself, my work and showcase my research projects and proposals.-->




<br>


ðŸŽ“ I am Otto Segersven, a postdoctoral researcher in social sciences, currently focused on AI literacy in education. My research interests encompass ethnic and religious relations, human-machine interactions, and human-nature connections. My overarching research commitment is to understand how we adopt and construct ways of knowing and conduct in the world through interactions with others and our environments. I'm a mixed methods researcher with a methodological toolkit that includes interviews, surveys, experimental design and computational methods.




Feel free to explore my [CV](cv/), [publications](/publications/) and [research projects](/projects/).

*Beyond professional life*


I'm a rock climber and ultra runner. Running liberates and empowers and I've formulated many of my best sentences on the run. Climbing clears my mind and is refreshingly purposeless.


I write poetry for the pleasure of crafting an original thought in an original way.  <!--Poetry helps me to touch the here and now and perhaps grasp a glimpse of the universal, intersubjective experience.-->


My native languages are Swedish and Finnish, my working language is English, in my everyday life in Berlin I speak mainly German and Spanish and I am still learning to speak Python with the computer.


I'm an avid consumer of news, particularly interested in politics, international affairs, economics, technology and global environmental change.
