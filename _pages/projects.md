Currently, I'm working on securing funding for a number of research projects:

1. [What Sets Us Apart? Identifying AI Enhanced Expertise in Human-Machine Interaction](#what-sets-us-apart)
2. [Emplacing Global Environmental Change](#emplacing-global)
3. [The Making and Maintenance of Ethnicity: A Computational Analysis](#making-Finland-Swedes)

    Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been insinuating into every aspect of our modern world for decades. With the recent release of highly fluent Large Language Models (LLMs), including deepfake technologies, the pace and range of AI’s integration into our lives has taken a quantum leap. With this leap, the importance of developing the knowledge required to ethically and effectively utilize AI, and to critically assess its impact on society is becoming widely recognized. This project focuses on how members of various social groups distinguish between human and AI-generated output. What kind of competences can be mimicked by a machine? What type of expertise is exclusively human? Focusing on expertise rather than intelligence means conceiving human knowledge and skills as shared and maintained within social groups and acquired through socialization. I employ the sociological Imitation Game (IG) method. This novel experimental technique enables deep ethnographic probes into human cultures. In the IG, a participant playing as “judge” communicates with anonymized purported experts in a specific domain. The judge’s task is to discern genuine experts from laypersons imitating experts, or from AI portraying either role. The experiment illuminates how human and artificial expertise are expressed and recognized in interactions. One of the significant strengths of the IG is its empowerment of participants to act as proxy researchers, which ensures that knowledge is generated through the diverse voices of participants themselves. The plan is to conduct IG experiments with rock climbers, vegans and scientists, against LLMs, such as ChatGPT. These groups were chosen to delve into the known limits of AI: embodiment, morality and tacit knowledge. The objective of this research is to improve the human condition by charting how expertise emerges from human-machine interaction and ultimately, attend to the perennial question of what makes us human.

    This initiative explores the concept of 'place' as a missing link between environmental knowledge and sustainable action. This science-art collaboration, involving a social scientist and a visual artist, immerses itself in El Chaltén, Argentina, a village situated deep in the Patagonian steppe within the Los Glaciares National Park. The project tackles an ongoing challenge identified by climate scholars: the gap between awareness of environmental issues and corresponding action. Concepts like CO2 levels and
    carbon footprints remain abstract and disconnected from everyday experiences. This project posits that 'place'—understood as physical, social, and cultural—can make global environmental change tangible and meaningful to diverse audiences.  
    El Chaltén, with its iconic Fitz Roy mountain range and melting glaciers, is a compelling case study. Its natural environment, visibly changing by global processes, reliance on high-carbon systems, and cosmopolitan population make it an ideal microcosm for examining how ubiquitous environmental challenges are perceived
    and acted upon locally by a global community.  
    The project integrates social scientific research with visual arts. The researcher explores how locals, seasonal workers, and visitors, navigate the tension between sustainable tourism amid a high-carbon system. It investigates how these communities construct a sense of place in their interactions, and the potential of a
    cosmopolitan sense of place and its potential for global sustainable action. The artist explores the subtle ways global environmental change is embedded within everyday life and specific forms of human-nature relationships. Boldly threading between disciplinary boundaries we create a multiformat resource, including scientific journal publications, photo essays, a book, video podcast, and exhibitions, designed to engage a diverse audience beyond academia and inspire change towards a more sustainable and just future.

## <a id="Making-Finland-Swedes">The Making and Maintenance of 'Finland-Swedes': A Computational Analysis of Swedish-speaking Newspapers in Finland 1910 - the present

    How is Finland-Swedishness created and maintained? This study examines the discursive construction of Finland-Swedes as an ethnic and linguistic group in Swedish-speaking newspapers in Finland, spanning from 1900 to the present. Scholars consider Finland-Swedes to be a successful minority, given their secure constitutional rights, as well as political, economic, and cultural power relative to their small population size. A crucial factor in this success stems from the creation of a robust ethno-political identity with a common bond and fate that is both part of, yet distinct within the Finnish nation.  Nevertheless, despite its success by international comparison, the population is gradually shrinking, and Finland-Swedes are actively seeking ways of increasing the vitality of the community in the face of an uncertain future.  Drawing on a newly digitized dataset of Swedish-speaking newspapers, this project traces the evolving discourse around Finland-Swedes, exploring how ethnic identities emerge and survive, as well as how they might prevail in a changing society. To make use of the vast textual data, the research employs a computational technique known as topic modeling to identify trends and patterns through automated systematic qualitative analysis. 

    The project focuses on three issues that are central to Finland-Swedish identity construction: <br>

  

    1. The impact of bilingualism and the role of bilinguals in the community. <br>

    2. The internal boundary maintenance between the urban south and rural north. <br>

    3. The development of a dual identity—identifying as both a Finn and a Finland-Swede. <br><br>
