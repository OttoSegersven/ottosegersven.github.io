Currently, I'm working on securing funding for a number of research projects:

1. What Sets Us Apart? Identifying AI Enhanced Expertise in Human-Machine Interaction
2. Emplacing Global Environmental Change
3. The Making and Maintenance of 'Finland-Swedes': A Computational Analysis of Swedish-speaking Newspapers in Finland 1910 - the present

# What Sets Us Apart? Identifying AI Enhanced Expertise in Human-Machine Interaction

    "Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been insinuating into every aspect of our modern world for decades. With the recent release of highly fluent Large Language Models (LLMs), including deepfake technologies, the pace and range of AI’s integration into our lives has taken a quantum leap. With this leap, the importance of developing the knowledge required to ethically and effectively utilize AI, and to critically assess its impact on society is becoming widely recognized. This project focuses on how members of various social groups distinguish between human and AI-generated output. What kind of competences can be mimicked by a machine? What type of expertise is exclusively human? Focusing on expertise rather than intelligence means conceiving human knowledge and skills as shared and maintained within social groups and acquired through socialization. I employ the sociological Imitation Game (IG) method. This novel experimental technique enables deep ethnographic probes into human cultures. In the IG, a participant playing as “judge” communicates with anonymized purported experts in a specific domain. The judge’s task is to discern genuine experts from laypersons imitating experts, or from AI portraying either role. The experiment illuminates how human and artificial expertise are expressed and recognized in interactions. One of the significant strengths of the IG is its empowerment of participants to act as proxy researchers, which ensures that knowledge is generated through the diverse voices of participants themselves. The plan is to conduct IG experiments with rock climbers, vegans and scientists, against LLMs, such as ChatGPT. These groups were chosen to delve into the known limits of AI: embodiment, morality and tacit knowledge. The objective of this research is to improve the human condition by charting how expertise emerges from human-machine interaction and ultimately, attend to the perennial question of what makes us human."

# Emplacing Global Environmental Change #

    "This initiative explores the concept of 'place' as a missing link between environmental knowledge and sustainable action. This science-art collaboration, involving a social scientist and a visual artist, immerses itself in El Chaltén, Argentina, a village situated deep in the Patagonian steppe within the Los Glaciares National Park. The project tackles an ongoing challenge identified by climate scholars: the gap between awareness of environmental issues and corresponding action. Concepts like CO2 levels and
    carbon footprints remain abstract and disconnected from everyday experiences. This project posits that 'place'—understood as physical, social, and cultural—can make global environmental change tangible and meaningful to diverse audiences.  
    El Chaltén, with its iconic Fitz Roy mountain range and melting glaciers, is a compelling case study. Its natural environment, visibly changing by global processes, reliance on high-carbon systems, and cosmopolitan population make it an ideal microcosm for examining how ubiquitous environmental challenges are perceived
    and acted upon locally by a global community.  
    The project integrates social scientific research with visual arts. The researcher explores how locals, seasonal workers, and visitors, navigate the tension between sustainable tourism amid a high-carbon system. It investigates how these communities construct a sense of place in their interactions, and the potential of a
    cosmopolitan sense of place and its potential for global sustainable action. The artist explores the subtle ways global environmental change is embedded within everyday life and specific forms of human-nature relationships. Boldly threading between disciplinary boundaries we create a multiformat resource, including scientific journal publications, photo essays, a book, video podcast, and exhibitions, designed to engage a diverse audience beyond academia and inspire change towards a more sustainable and just future."

# The Making and Maintenance of 'Finland-Swedes': A Computational Analysis of Swedish-speaking Newspapers in Finland 1910 - the present  #

    "How is Finland-Swedishness made and maintained? This is a study of the discursive construction of Finland-Swedes as an ethnic and linguistic group in Swedish-speaking newspapers in Finland, from 1900 until the present. It utilizes a computational technique known as topic modelling, which allows for systematic qualitative analysis of large textual data. The objective is to trace the transformation of discourse over time, and contribute to our understanding of how ethnicities emerge and prevail through modernity until today"
